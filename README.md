### <a name="Description"></a>Descriptions:

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Operations. In this homework assignment, the challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
